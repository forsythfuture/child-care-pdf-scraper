# This script creates a data set of Forsyth County
# child care facilites that are geo coded by adding the lat / long
# to the address.  It feeds the address to the Google Maps API
# to retrieve the lat / long
#
# Note: Users will need to set up a Google API key!!
# use `register_google(key = '')` to enter your Google Maps API key into R
