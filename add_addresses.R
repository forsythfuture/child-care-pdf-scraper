#
# This script builds a web-scrapper to automatically search for, and add,
# the addresses of all facilities. It performs the operations through the
# following steps:
# 
# Iterate through each facility ID and do the following:
#   1. navigate to http://ncchildcaresearch.dhhs.state.nc.us/search.asp;
#   2. enter the facility ID in the top search box;
#   3. press enter; and
#   4. scrape the address from the resulting page.
#
# The script uses RSelenium, which is based on the selenium web driver,
# to enter search terms into a text box. The selenium web server is started
# through a docker image. Installing docker and running the image is beyond
# the scope of this script. But, information cna be found here:
#  http://ropensci.github.io/RSelenium/articles/docker.html
